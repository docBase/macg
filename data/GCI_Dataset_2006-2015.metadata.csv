In the absence of reliable data on PCT applications for Taiwan (China) and Hong Kong SAR, two advanced economies that are not signatories of the Treaty, the number of applications is estimated as follows: first, we compute the average number of all utility patent applications filed with the United States Patents and Trademarks Office (USPTO) for 2011 and 2012. We then compute the average number of PCT applications for 2011 and 2012, before computing the ratio of the two averages (1.59). For the computation of the two averages, only economies with a two-year average number of at least 100 USPTO applications and 50 PCT applications are considered. Taiwan and Hong Kong are excluded in both cases. We then divide the 2011-2012 average number of USPTO applications filed by residents of Taiwan (19,951.5) and Hong Kong (1,061.5), respectively, by the ratio above in order to produce estimates for PCT applications. As a final step, we compute the estimates per million population—that is, 537.2 for Taiwan and 90.3 for Hong Kong.
